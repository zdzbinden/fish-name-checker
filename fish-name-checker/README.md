# Fish Name Checker

A static web app that validates scientific fish names in manuscript text against
*Common and Scientific Names of Fishes from the United States, Canada, and Mexico*,
8th edition (Page et al., 2023), published by the American Fisheries Society (AFS)
and the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (ASIH).

## How to use

1. Visit the deployed URL (GitHub Pages).
2. Paste your manuscript text into the text box.
3. Click **Check Names** (or press Ctrl/⌘+Enter).
4. Review the highlighted preview and the issues table.
5. Click **Copy corrected text** to copy the text with outdated/misspelled names
   automatically replaced by the suggested corrections.

### Color coding

| Color  | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green  | **Valid** — exact match in the 8th edition |
| Blue   | **Changed in 8th edition** — name is valid but was reassigned or revised since the 7th edition; confirm this is the intended species (hover for current common name) |
| Orange | **Outdated / Synonym** — replaced by a different name; suggestion shown with common name |
| Red    | **Misspelled** — close match found; check the suggestion |
| Purple | **Unknown** — genus looks fish-like but no close species match |

Hover over any highlighted name to see its common name or suggested correction.

## Data pipeline

The name database (`data/fish_names.json`) is built in two steps:

### Step 1 — Parse the AFS table PDF

```powershell
uv run --with pymupdf python ../parse_pdf.py
```

Source: `../names_of_fishes/Names-of-Fishes-8-Table1.pdf`
(The table-only PDF distributed by AFS — not the full book.)

Extracts ~5,086 species with full metadata per entry:
`class`, `order`, `family`, `author`, `occurrence`, `flags`, `common_name_en`,
`common_name_es`, `common_name_fr`

### Step 2 — Enrich with synonyms from Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes

```powershell
uv run --with requests --with beautifulsoup4 python ../scrape_eschmeyer.py
```

Queries https://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/ for
each species and adds older/synonymized names to `fish_names.json`. Handles both
strict synonyms and genus transfers (reclassifications).

Results are cached to `../eschmeyer_cache.json` so interrupted runs resume cleanly.
The full run takes ~3 hours at a respectful request rate.

## Running locally

The app loads `data/fish_names.json` via `fetch()`, so it must be served over HTTP
(opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL will fail in most browsers).

```powershell
cd fish-name-checker
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Updating the data (new edition)

When a new edition of *Names of Fishes* is published:

1. Replace `../names_of_fishes/Names-of-Fishes-8-Table1.pdf` with the new table PDF.
2. Re-run the parser:
   ```powershell
   uv run --with pymupdf python ../parse_pdf.py
   ```
3. Delete `../eschmeyer_cache.json` and re-run the synonym scraper:
   ```powershell
   uv run --with requests --with beautifulsoup4 python ../scrape_eschmeyer.py
   ```
4. Commit and push `data/fish_names.json`.

## GitHub Pages deployment

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**, set Source to the branch and `/ (root)` or the
   `fish-name-checker/` folder, depending on your repo layout.
3. The `.nojekyll` file in this directory prevents GitHub Pages from running
   Jekyll, which would interfere with the `data/` directory.
