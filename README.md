---

Keeping up with fish taxonomy is hard. Names get revised, genera get
reshuffled, and the 8th edition introduced hundreds of changes. **FISHFINDER**
scans your manuscript text and flags every scientific fish name that is outdated,
misspelled, or changed since the previous edition -- so you can submit with
confidence.

## What it does

Paste your text, hit **SCAN**, and every binomial is color-coded:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Green** | Valid in the 8th edition |
| **Blue** | Valid but changed since the 7th edition -- confirm the intended species |
| **Orange** | Outdated synonym -- suggested replacement shown |
| **Red** | Likely misspelling -- closest match shown |
| **Purple** | Genus looks fish-like but no species match found |

Hover any highlighted name to see its common name or correction.
Click **COPY** to get your text back with outdated names auto-replaced.

## Try it

> **Live site:** *Coming soon on GitHub Pages*

To run locally:

```
cd fishfinder
python -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## How the data is built

The name database is assembled in two stages:

1. **Parse** the AFS table PDF (~5,086 species with full metadata)
2. **Enrich** with synonyms scraped from [Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes](https://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/) (genus transfers, strict synonyms, and historical synonym chains)

See [`fishfinder/README.md`](fishfinder/README.md) for full pipeline documentation.
